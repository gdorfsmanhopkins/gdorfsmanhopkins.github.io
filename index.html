        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>I am a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley as part of the Research Training Group in Arithmetic Geometry under the mentorship of Professor Martin Olsson. I am also a <a href="https://www.mmuf.org/">Mellon Mays Fellow</a>.  This academic year I am on the tenure track job market.  Here is a link to my <a href="./files/CV_Complete.pdf">CV</a>.</p>

        <p>My mathematical research lives at the intersection of algebraic geometry and number theory, specifically in p-adic and rigid analytic geometry, and much of my work has centered around developing geometric foundations in the theory of perfectoid spaces.</p>

        <p>I am also interested in exploring the intersection of mathematics and visual art, and before arriving at Berkeley was in residence at ICERM at Brown University with a diverse and interdisciplinary research group of artists, mathematicians, journalists, and educators during the <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-f19/">Illustrating Mathematics</a> semester program. My media focus includes computational and digital fabrication--such 3D printing and computer graphics--as well as exploring textile and fabric arts such as crochet.</p>

        <p><b>I love to teach!</b> Whether sharing math in the classroom setting or office hours, running workshops on using laser cutters, 3d printers, or microcontrollers, teaching others how to crochet, or participating in learning seminars about cutting edge math research, sharing and learning as part of a community is the fuel that keeps me going.  <b>I also supervise undergraduate research projects,</b> and have advised projects across various disciplines including algebraic geometry, number theory, cryptography, mathematical art, and computer graphics.</p>

        <p>I completed my PhD at the University of Washington under the advising of Professor Max Lieblich. During this time I was a mentor in the <a href="http://wxml.math.washington.edu/">Washington Experimental Math Lab</a> advising several undergraduate research projects. I was also the manager of the WXML <a href="http://www.wxml.math.washington.edu/?cat=10">digital fabrication lab</a>.</p>
