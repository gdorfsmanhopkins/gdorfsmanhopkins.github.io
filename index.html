        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>I am a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley as part of the Research Training Group in Arithmetic Geometry under the mentorship of Professor Martin Olsson. I am also a <a href-"https://www.mmuf.org/">Mellon Mays Fellow</a>.  My mathematical research lives at the intersection of algebraic geometry and number theory, and centers around nonarchimedean and
          rigid analytic geometry, with a particular emphasis on establishing the geometric foundations of perfectoid spaces. <b>This year, I am on the tenure track job market.  Here is a link to my <a href="./files/CV_Complete.pdf">CV</a></b>.</p>

        <p>I am interested in exploring the intersection of mathematics and visual art, and before arriving at Berkeley was in residence at ICERM at Brown University with a diverse and interdisciplinary research group of artists, mathematicians,
          journalists, and educators during the semester: <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-f19/">Illustrating Mathematics</a>. I mainly focus in computational and digital fabrication--such 3D printing and computer graphics--as well as
          exploring textile and fabric arts such as crochet. Much of the work coming out of this semester program appears in the AMS publication <i><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-135">Illustrating Mathematics</i></a> edited by Diana Davis.</p>

        <p>I completed my PhD at the University of Washington under the advising of Professor Max Lieblich. During this time I was a mentor in the <a href="http://wxml.math.washington.edu/">Washington Experimental Math Lab</a> advising several
          undergraduate research projects. I was also the manager of the WXML <a href="http://www.wxml.math.washington.edu/?cat=10">digital fabrication lab</a>.</p>

        <p>I create nonmathematical art as well, and I have lately been exploring mechatronic and interactive art. I enjoy creating sculpture and installations which are made interactive through the addition of electronics and microcontrollers (such
          as Arduino). Most recently I have been exploring the integrating electronics into crochet, a medium I have found remarkably flexible (both literally and figuratively).</p>

        <p><b>I love to teach!</b> Whether sharing math in the classroom setting, running workshops on using laser cutters, 3d printers, or microcontrollers, teaching others how to crochet, or participating in learning seminars about cutting edge
          math research, sharing and learning as part of a community is the fuel that keeps me going.</p>
