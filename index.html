        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>I am currently a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley in Arithmetic Geometry, as part of the research training group in arithmetic geometry.  My mathematical research lives at the intersection of algebraic geometry and number theory, and centers around nonarchimedean and rigid analytic geometry, with a particular emphasis on establishing the geometric foundations of perfectoid spaces.  I have lately been curious about structures of line and vector bundles on perfectoid covers of varieties and schemes, which includes developing a notion of projective geometry for perfectoid spaces.  I'm also interested in applications to p-adic hodge theory, the Langlands program, and studying the Brauer group.</p>

        <p>I am also interested in exploring the intersection of mathematics and visual art, and before arriving at Berkeley was in residence at ICERM at Brown University for their semester session: <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-f19/">Illustrating Mathematics</a>, working with such a diverse and interdisciplinary research group of artists, mathematicians, journalists, educators, and students.  I'm interested in computational and digital fabrication--such 3D printing and computer graphics--as well as exploring textile and fabric arts such as crochet.  Much of the work coming out of this semester program will be appearing in the forthcoming AMS publication also titled Illustrating Mathematics.</p>

        <p>Before that I did a PhD at the University of Washington under the advising of Professor Max Lieblich.  During this time I was a mentor in the Washington Experimental Math Lab advising several undergraduate research programs.  I was also the manager of the WXML digital fabrication lab.</p>

        <p>I also participate in nonmathematical art, and I have lately been exploring mechatronic and interactive art.  I enjoy creating sculpture and installations which are made interactive through the addition of electronics and microcontrollers (such as Arduino).  Most recently I have been exploring the integrating electronics into crochet, a medium I have found remarkably flexible (both literally and figuratively).</p>
