    <h1>Playing with javascript</h1>
		<p>
			I'm currently trying to teach myself javascript in order to create animated and interactive ways to engage with mathematical concepts online.  Here are a few things I've made in the recent experimentation process.  This is hardly even a work in progress, and more accurately a documentation of my learning phase, so everything is quite rough, if you have any advice or comments or advice please let me know!

		<ul>
			<li><a href="dynamicCubicSurface/dynamicCubicSurface.html">A family of parametric cubic surfaces you can deform by dragging sliders change the  coefficients.</a></li>
			<li><a href="sliderControlledSurface/sliderControlledSurface.html">Playing with interference of sine waves</a></li>
			<li><a href="dynamicSliderSurface/dynamicSliderSurface.html">Similar to above, but the frequencies are modulating rapidly and you can control the rate of modulation</a></li>
			<li><a href="crown/crown.html">Playing with sine waves and tubes and animations to make a dancing crown</a></li>
			<li><a href="growingUp/slither.html">Playing with sine waves and tubes and animations to make a climbing spring.</a></li>
