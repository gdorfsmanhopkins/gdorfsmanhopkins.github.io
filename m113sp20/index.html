		About this course
	</h3>
	<p>
    You are likely familiar with algebra as being a (perhaps tedious) exercise in solving equations.  The structures of addition and multiplication, and the way they intertwine, allow us explicitly to extract information (solve) from relationships (equations).
    <br>
    Abstract algebra is the rigorous study binary operations, that is, functions which take to inputs and one output.  You are already familiar with some binary operations (addition and multiplication of integers, for example), but it turns out there are many many more (addition and multiplication of matrices, composition of functions, mixing colors, applying symmetries, permutations and card shuffles, the list goes on).  In studying the abstract properties of binary operations and their interactions, we will discover that they all share many very strong underlying structural properties, which allows us to extract information for given relationships (i.e., solve equations), in many different contexts.  This leads to applications in cryptology, geometry, logic and even philosophy which we may glance at if time allows.
    <br>
    Along the way we will gain experience in proof writing and mathematical exposition and communication.

  <h3>More Information</h3>
  <h4>Structure</h4>
  <p>Mathematics is not a spectator sport, and watching someone do abstract algebra is much like reading the New York Times backwards.  All the information may be there, but it will take some unscrambling to make sense of it.  Therefore I plan to lecture enough to introduce the necessary concepts, but spend much of the time working through examples and exercises with your help.  This will include time to work through examples and exercises in class.  For this reason, it is a good idea to be a bit ahead in the reading, and ready to toy with some problems in class.  There will also be many written exercises collected as homework assignments, as well as takehome and in class exams.</p>
  <h4>Homework</h4>
    <p>There will be written homework collected almost every week <b>on Fridays</b>.  They will be assigned a week before they are due, and mostly be problems from the book, but keep in mind that some of the problems may require material discussed on the Monday before they are due as well.  These assignments will be proofs, as well as computations.  It is preferable that they are typed up using LaTeX, or a similar mathematical typesetting language.  Feel free to work in groups, but each student must write up their results separately.</p>
  <h4>Take Home Tests</h4>
    <p>There will be two take home tests.  These will look similar to the homework assignments but differ in the following important ways.  First, they will be assigned on Friday and due on Monday.  Second, you must work on them yourself.  Third, they will consist primarily of proof writing.  You may use the course texts ([DF] and [P]), as well as your course notes.  You may <i>not</i> use the internet or your peers.  They are in theory cumulative, but in practice will reflect material most recently covered.</p>
  <h4>In Class Exams</h4>
    <p>There will be one midterm and one final.  The midterm will be the day before spring break, and the final during finals week.  These will both be cumulative, and will include both computation and examples.</p>
	<h4>A note on proof writing</h4>
		<p><a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~hutching/teach/proofs.pdf">I find these notes on proof writing to be amusing and informative.</a></p>
