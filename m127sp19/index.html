		About this course
	</h3>
	<p>
		This course is designed to be a gentle introduction the the theory of mathematical cryptography.  This is a beautiful and very concrete application of some more abstract and theoretical mathematics.  The main goal will be to get an understanding of public key cryptography and RSA.  If we have any time left we may explore the geometric enhancement using elliptic curves.
	</p>
	<p>
		Along the way we will introduce some modern number theory, abstract algebra, and a bit linear algebra of probability theory.  We will also spend some time warming up to a theorem-proof style of abstract mathematics.  The pace will be relatively gentle, and the goal is to explore some modern mathematics with a very concrete application to guide us.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will also be using mathematical software to implement some algorithms of our own.  I'd reccommend sage, wich is a free add on to python, and can also be run in your browser at cocalc.com.
